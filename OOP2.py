'''
Create a class named StringManipulation that has the following specification:

Attributes

words: list of strings, all of which will be in lower case

Methods

(1) __init__: accept a list words as argument and assign it to the corresponding attribute
(2) total_words: return the total number of words in words
(3) count: accept an argument named some_word and return the number of times this word occurs in the list words
(4) words_of_length: accept a positive integer length as argument and return a list of all the words in the list words that have a length equal to length
(5) words_start_with: accept a character char as argument and return the list of all the words in words that start with char
(6) longest_word: return the longest word in the list words; if there are multiple words that satisfy this condition, return the first such occurrence
(7) palindromes: return a list of all the words that are palindromes in words
