    Given three points a, b, and c on the Cartesian plane, 
    calculate the Manhattan distance to go from point a to point c via point b.

    Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates.

    Args:
        a (tuple): Coordinates of point a as (x1, y1).
        b (tuple): Coordinates of point b as (x2, y2).
        c (tuple): Coordinates of point c as (x3, y3).

    Returns:
        int: The Manhattan distance from point a to point c via point b.
