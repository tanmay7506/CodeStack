# sum_of_squares - find the sum of squares of numbers in a list - (mapping and aggregation)
# total_cost - given quantitiy and price of each item as a list of tuples find the total cost using list comprehensions
# abbreviation - given a string with multiple words seperated by space, form an abbrevation out of it by taking the first letter in caps. (mapping and aggregation)
# palindromes - given a list of strings, create a new list with only palindromes filtering
# all_chars_from_big_words - find the all unique characters (case insensitive, make all lowercase) from all words with size greater than 5 in a given sentence with words seperated by spaces. (filtering)
# flatten - flatten a nested list using comprehension
# unflatten - given a flat list and number of rows, create a matrix (2d list) with that number of rows. (nested-aggregation)
# make_identity_matrix - make an identity (with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere) given the size.
# make_lower_triangular_matrix - given number of rows m, create a lower triangular matrix like the pattern below. for m = 5
