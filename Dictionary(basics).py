dictionary_operations(fruit_prices: dict, fruits: list)

Perform a series of operations on the given fruit_prices dictionary based on the fruits list:

Add fruits[0] with a cost of 3.
Modify the cost of fruits[1] to 2.
Increase the cost of fruits[2] by 2.
Delete fruits[3] from fruit_prices.
Print the price of fruits[4].
Print the names of fruits in fruit_prices as a sorted list.
Print the prices of fruits in fruit_prices as a sorted list.
increase_prices(fruit_prices: dict) -> None

Increase the prices of every fruit by 20% and round to two decimal places. Modify the dictionary in place.

dict_from_string(string: str, key_type, value_type)

Convert a string with comma-separated key-value pairs into a dictionary, converting the keys and values to the specified types.

dict_to_string(D: dict) -> str

Convert a dictionary back into a string with each key-value pair on a new line, using comprehensions.
